# Automarker (assignment 1) #
## Prerequisites ##
1. Download student files from SAFE.
2. To generate tests do:
    ```
    ./automark.sh gentest
    ```
  (make sure that `test1.pl` is in the same directory as `automark.sh`)

3. Do `./automark.sh /path/to/ASGNM1` to automark the submissions.
4. Edit `/path/to/ASGNM1/<candidate_numbers>/comments.txt` with feedback and marks.
5. Generate a CSV file with marks for SAFE with `./automark.sh /path/to/ASGNM1 safe`.

**Tip:** if the automarking scripts seems to be taking forever to mark a student submission press `Control-C`, then type `a` and press `Enter`. This will abort execution of the student's submission.

## Automarker usage ##
```
Please supply an argument containing a path to a folder with submissions
    `./automark.sh /path/to/ASGNM1`
...or just a single submission file
    `./automark.sh /path/to/ASGNM1/12345/assignment1_12345.pl`
You can also check a particular question
    `./automark.sh /path/to/ASGNM1 question` or
    `./automark.sh /path/to/ASGNM1/12345/assignment1_12345.pl question`

Alternatively you can generate automarking tests
    `./automark.sh gentest`
...or generate a csv file for SAFE submission
    `./automark.sh /path/to/ASGNM1 safe`
```

## Answers comparison ##
If you need to compare answers for the *q4* then copy the student's submission to the root of this repository, run assignment 1 with `./ailp.pl assignment1` and do the following in the `swipl` interpreter:
```
['ailp/library/assignment1_automarkrc.pl'].

ailp_start_position(A),q4a(B),answerQ4a(A,B).
ailp_start_position(A),q4b(B),answerQ4b(A,B).
ailp_start_position(A),q4c(B),answerQ4c(A,B).
ailp_start_position(A),q4d(B),answerQ4d(A,B).

ailp_start_position(A),q4a(B),reverse(B,C),answerQ4a(A,C).
ailp_start_position(A),q4b(B),reverse(B,C),answerQ4b(A,C).
ailp_start_position(A),q4c(B),reverse(B,C),answerQ4c(A,C).
ailp_start_position(A),q4d(B),reverse(B,C),answerQ4d(A,C).
```

## Marking criteria ##
The mark break-down is as follows:
```
Q1:    1
Q2a:   1
Q2b:   1
Q3:    1
Q4a:   2
Q4b:   2
Q4c:   2
Q4d:   2
Q5a:   3
Q5b:   3
Q6:    5
Extra: 2
```

The assignment is marked by filling in `comments.txt` file for each student. In that file you should have a look at the automarker output for each answer and mark it appropriately using the marks breakdown at the top of the file. Once you mark all of the questions please add add up all the marks and fill in *total* field in the marks breakdown section of the file. Part of the assignment needs to be marked manually. In the section below, there is an example output for one student. This is generated by the automarker, and then the marks at the top are added; Q5 and Q6 are marked manually. Sometimes the automarker fails because the answers are malformatted, in which case they need manual marking.

### Guidelines ###
Marking Q1, Q2 and Q3 is straight forward.

If part of the Q4 is wrong it is advised to check why and if the answer is almost correct give 1 or 2 marks; e.g. if the path is right but in reverse give 1 mark.

An answer to Q5 receives 3 marks if it is correct; 2 marks if, for example, the answer is missing the first movement from the start position to the first corner, unless the start position is a corner; finally, 1 mark for a good attempt e.g. the answer uses internal library predicates but it, more or less, works.

Marks for Q6 are deduced if the predicate returns infinite number of answers, if it returns more than one answer and there are duplicates or some of them are incorrect, if it returns incorrect or reversed answers, if it uses internal library predicates, etc.

Extra marks are awarded if the Q6 spiral is given both clockwise and anticlockwise, the spiral is done from all 4 corners and the predicate works for any grid size.

## Example auto-marker output ##

Marks breakdown
q1: 1/1 
q2a: 1/1 
q2b: 1/1 
q3: 1/1 
q4a: 2/2 
q4b: 2/2 
q4c: 2/2 
q4d: 2/2 
q5a: 3/3 
q5b: 3/3 
q6: 3/5 
extra: 0/2 
total: 21/25

```

## To do ##
- Consider implementing "automarker as a service".
- Fix automarker search depth bound.
- Streamline checking reversed paths given as an answer to Q4.
